## Graphs description

first number:
1. rectangular barrier
1. triangular barrier
1. rectangulat barrier, double gauss, distance between gausses = 12
1. rectangular barrier, function of potential width

pw - potential width
e  - energy

e.g. 0-pw1.0 is a function of energy with rectangular barrier of width 1.0.
